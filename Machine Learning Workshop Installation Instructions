To prepare for this workshop, please follow the steps below to download the programs and we’ll teach you the rest!
(There's no need to do this if you have already attended a DSI workshop and have done it.)

Download and install Anaconda Python distribution for PYTHON 2. WE ARE USING PYTHON 2, NOT PYTHON 3. (this includes
Jupyter, a Python interpreter that will allow you to run iPython notebooks)

Use this link:

Download the iPython notebooks and files from GitHub. Just click “clone or download" in the top right-hand corner,
and select "download zip"

Use this link:

Open up the Anaconda launcher, the Jupyter page will open in a web browser, and navigate to the location of the
downloaded files. Through the Jupyter webpage, you will be able to run the iPython inotebook.

The workshop that we will be using is Machine Learning Workshop Symposium – Student.ipynb.
